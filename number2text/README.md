Write a program that converts numbers to theirs text representation.
====

Example:

Input: `1123`

Output: `one thousand one hundred twenty-three`

Requirements:
- Program has to be written in standard C++ language (no third party libraries and OS API).
- Using STL is a plus.
- Code must be easy readable and as simple as possible
- Object oriented design should be used.
- Program should work correct with wrong input.
- Default language is English. But program must have a possibility to quickly add another language for output
(no need to implement any other language support, just create flexible design)


Please make attention to the correctness of output.
The result of the function that make conversion must contain only text representation of the input number.
Any extra characters like spaces in the begin or end of the result will be considered as mistake.
The result must be in lower case.
